In this problem set, we will get some hands-on practice by implementing local search for the **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**, which operates in a fully-observable, single-agent, deterministic, episodic, static, and discrete environment. We will also get some hands-on practice on Adversarial Search by coding an AI to play the game **Breakthrough**.\n",

    "Your cousin Ben Bitdiddle is planning to start a company which sells premium imported chocolate from Europe. Among all cities in the country, Ben must choose one to be his company headquarters to receive shipment from Europe and devise a route from the headquarters to deliver the chocolate to every other city. This route must only visit each city **exactly once** and return to the headquarters to receive the next shipment. In addition, to save fuel cost, the route must be **as short as possible**. Given a list of cities and the distance between every two cities, what is the shortest possible route?\n",

    "This problem is a classic NP-hard optimisation problem in computer science. In this task, you will design and implement a local search algorithm to find a shortest route. You must find the route as **a list of cities** in the order of travel from the starting city to the last city before returning.\n",

    "Recall that similar to A* search, local search utilises evaluation functions to decide how to transition from one state to another. However, being an uninformed guy, your cousin Ben Bitdiddle tells you to use the \"greedy\" solution. Given an incomplete route, the \"greedy\" solution builds a path by adding the closest unvisited node from the last visited node, until all nodes are visited. For instance, in the graph above, the \"greedy\" solution is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.\n",

    "* Your own evaluation functions and transition functions may underperform against the greedy solution for small instances of TSP, but should outperform the greedy solution consistently for large instances. For our public and private test cases, we have designed the greedy solution to be suboptimal.\n",

    "\n",
    "Compared to previous search algorithms you have seen (uninformed search, A* search), why do you think local search is more suitable for this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Local search is more suitable for this problem as it is a optimization problem where the path to the goal is irrelevant and goal can be any state. Uninformed search and A* search are not suitable for this problem as they are used to find the path to the goal state, and will have to search through all possible states to find the optimal solution without a goal state. Furthermore, as the number of cities increases, the number of possible states increases factorially, making it inefficient to use uninformed search or A* search. Local search, on the other hand, can still be used to find the optimal solution since it only requires the current state and the next state to evaluate. A* also requires a heuristic function which is not suitable for this problem since the goal state is not known."

    "\n",
    "Breakthrough was the winner of the 2001 8 × 8 Game Design Competition, sponsored by *About.com* and *Abstract Games Magazine*. When Dan Troyka formulated it, it was originally for a 7×7 board. We’re going to play it on a 6×6 board to limit the complexity. In terms of our terminology for the agent environment, Breakthrough is a fully observable, strategic, deterministic game. The game always results in a win for one of the two players.\n",
    "\n",
    "How exactly do you design an agent to play this game and, most importantly, win? An agent takes sensory input and reasons about it, and then outputs an action at each time step. You thus need to create a program that can read in a representation of the board (that’s the input) and output a legal move in Breakthrough. You then need an evaluation function to evaluate how good a position is.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem set, you will first implement a minimax agent, followed by augmenting it with alpha-beta pruning. You will then implement an improved evaluation function."

Black can move its pawns forward towards the bottom of the board, while white can move its pawns forward towards the top of the board.

    "- `is_valid_move(board, src, dst, current_player)`: It takes in the board configuration, move source, move destination and current player colour as its parameters. It returns `True` if the move is valid and returns `False` if the move is invalid.\n",
    "- `make_move(curr_board, src, dst, current_player, in_place=True)`: Given a board configuration, move source and move destination and current player colour, this function updates the board configuration based on the indicated move. This function updates the board configuration by modifying existing values if `in_place` is set to `True`, or creating a new board with updated values if `in_place` is set to `False`.\n",

Of course this is not necessarily the case since you only need one piece to make it through while the rest remain behind, but this is just a heuristic after all. Thus, in this heuristic you are about to implement, we add more points if a black piece is closer to the end, and subtract more points if a white piece is closer to the end.

Similarly, if white has no pieces, return `breakthrough.WIN`, and if black has no pieces, return `-breakthrough.WIN`.
